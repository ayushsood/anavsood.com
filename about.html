 <p>Anav Sood is a sixteen year old student who attends Shaker Heights High School. Originally from India, he moved to the US when he was only three years old. </p>

  <p>Anav’s brother introduced him to a keyboard synthesizer when he was in fifth grade. He was blown away. He began taking classical piano lessons with the hopes he could convince his parents to buy him the keyboard. This started Anav’s musical journey. However, it wasn’t until much later when music really took a hold of him. In eight grade, Anav started to play saxaphone in his school’s jazz band. By happenstance he was asked to play the piano and his world has never been the same. Since then, jazz performance and composition has turned into his art and passion. In 2014, he attended the Berklee College of Music on a full scholarship, where he continued to developed his interests.</p>

  <p>From a young age, Anav has also been very interested in math and science. He has expanded his interest by spending time with the Case Western Reserve University’s physics department. Under the department’s direction he helped complete a project involving photon density in the night sky. Anav thoroughly enjoys mathematics and hopes to continue to study it rigorously in college.</p>

  <p>In the future, Anav hopes to jointly pursue studies in science and mathematics with a formal education in music. He looks forward to the future, and finding the interesting overlaps between the two starkly different fields of study.</p>
